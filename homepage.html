        <p> <h1>  WHAT IS NETWORK <br> <br> <br> <h3>Turn On Network Discovery from the Settings App
            Network Discovery is turned on by default when you are connected with private networks, however, since not every public network is safe, it is turned off by default. Moreover, you could also have configured your PC in a way that Network Discovery is turned off by default even for private networks.
            
            To do so, first, head to the Start Menu and click on the ‘Settings’ tile present under the ‘Pinned apps’ section to continue. Otherwise, type ‘Settings’ in the menu to perform a search for it </h3> </h1> </p>
